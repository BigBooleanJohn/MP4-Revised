I wanted to make a program that ca take data from the 2013 giants, save it to the 
c program in structures, and then allow the user to choose from a variety of data analitics
options. I need to make functions that store it into a linked list, and use that linked list
to average and analyze the data

[ckeck] it takes command line args

[check] when given too few files, the program returns and issues a statement that tells the user
how to recover.

[check] when given the wrong files, the program checks to see if the pointer from fopen is null, and
then issues errors accordingly

[check] program properly stores the data from the datafile into a linked list

[check]: when given the output to end the program, the program ends with a kind message
